I created this project some time ago to test the basic game dev functionalities in the godot engine.

I created the game's first cutscene and explored some code possibilities. My conclusion is that the engine is very robust and viable for any project I may develop.

If this project is useful to you for any reason, use it without fear and you will be happy.
